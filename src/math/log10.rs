/// Computes decimal logarithm of a number.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// Theoretical input domain is (0, max(f32)] â‰ˆ (0, 3.40282347e+38], but near
/// zero the values get quite inaccurate.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use nikisas::log10;
/// assert_eq!(log10(100.0), 2.0);
/// ```
///
/// # Implementation details
///
/// The following identity is used for computation of log10(x):
///
/// ```plain
///   log10(x) = ln(x) / ln(10) = ln(x) * log10(e)
/// ```
///
/// For computing ln(x) we use [`ln`] routine and log10(e) is precomputed
/// constant.
///
/// We would like to get exact values when the input number is a power of ten.
/// However, in this case it's not that straightforward as in [`pow2`]. We
/// fallback to the following faithful determination: If the computed value of
/// log10(x) is close to an integer, than we assume that the input was indeed a
/// power of ten. Then we return the rounded value. This is not always true
/// because the tolerance for "closeness" is a bit bigger than in other cases
/// throughout this library.
